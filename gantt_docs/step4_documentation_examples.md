# Implementation Step 4: Documentation & Examples

As suggested by the concept and `COMPOSABLE_GANTT.md`:

- Use Storybook to showcase selection and keyboard behavior.
- Document API props, events, and slots, including the rationale from the design file.
- Provide example integrations demonstrating selection, drag-and-drop, and styling via data attributes.

## Task
- Create an expanded documentation plan referencing `COMPOSABLE_GANTT.md` and existing Storybook/VitePress setups.
- [ ] Outline Storybook sections
- [ ] Example docs pages
- [ ] Integration demonstrations
