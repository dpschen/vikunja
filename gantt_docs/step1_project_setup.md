# Implementation Step 1: Project Setup

From the implementation concept derived from `COMPOSABLE_GANTT.md`:

- Bootstrap a new package using Vite, TypeScript, and Vue 3.
- Implement a core composable `useGantt` and headless primitives `<GanttChartPrimitive>` and `<GanttRowPrimitive>`.
- Keep the library unstyled so integrators can apply their own classes or Tailwind utilities.

## Task
- Extend this setup guide with concrete initialization commands and folder layouts, citing `COMPOSABLE_GANTT.md` along with other setup best practices.
