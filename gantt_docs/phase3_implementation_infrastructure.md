# Phase 3: Implementation & Infrastructure

`COMPOSABLE_GANTT.md` outlines the tooling and project structure for building the library:

- Use Vite with TypeScript and Vue 3 alongside Vitest and Playwright.
- Organize code under `src/composables/`, `src/components/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/utils/`, and `src/styles/` (initially empty).
- Follow VueUse patterns such as `configurableWindow`, `tryOnUnmounted`, and `isSupported` flags.
- Provide ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and unstyled outputs with data-state attributes for styling.

## Task
- Expand on build tools, directory conventions, and accessibility patterns using `COMPOSABLE_GANTT.md` and additional references.
- [ ] Build tool configuration overview
- [ ] Recommended directory layout
- [ ] Accessibility checklist for primitives
