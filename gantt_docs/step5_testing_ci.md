# Implementation Step 5: Testing & CI

Implementation also calls for automated checks:

- Create unit tests with Vitest and integration tests with Playwright.
- Integrate linting, testing, and build steps into GitHub Actions.
- Ensure keyboard interactions and accessibility states are tested.

## Task
- Provide a full CI configuration outline using `COMPOSABLE_GANTT.md` as a starting point and referencing common GitHub Actions patterns.
