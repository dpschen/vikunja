# Phase 5: Documentation & Distribution

The final phase covers how to document and ship the library. Notes from `COMPOSABLE_GANTT.md`:

- Create interactive docs with VitePress and VueUse-style demos.
- Provide Storybook stories for each primitive and composed component.
- Publish the package to npm with side‑effect‑free entrypoints and type declarations.
- Follow semantic versioning with a CHANGELOG and a migration guide from vue-ganttastic.

## Task
- Elaborate on distribution workflow and documentation site structure using information from `COMPOSABLE_GANTT.md` and related resources.
