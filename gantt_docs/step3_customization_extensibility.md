# Implementation Step 3: Customization and Extensibility

This step ensures that users can extend the library. Notes from `COMPOSABLE_GANTT.md` and the concept include:

- Expose configuration options via composables, e.g., `useGantt({ start, end, precision })`.
- Provide optional Tailwind-based wrappers for quicker styling.
- Keep primitives headless so custom styles and behaviors can be layered on top.

## Task
- Write an extended customization guide referencing `COMPOSABLE_GANTT.md` and other libraries that support composable customization.
