# Phase 1: Landscape & Style Research

This phase focuses on exploring best practices for headless component design and styling conventions. Key points from `COMPOSABLE_GANTT.md` include:

- Study Headless UI primitives and accessibility model.
- Review VueUse composable guidelines covering option objects, reactivity, and `isSupported` flags.
- Analyze Reka UI's class-through APIs and WAI-ARIA compliance.
- Inspect vue-ganttastic to understand its API surface and slot usage.

## Task
- Expand this document with deeper research from `COMPOSABLE_GANTT.md` and other sources, detailing specific takeaways and references for each bullet point.
