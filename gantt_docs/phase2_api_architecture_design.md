# Phase 2: API & Architecture Design

In this phase the project defines the core composables and renderless components. Highlights from `COMPOSABLE_GANTT.md`:

- Draft composables such as `useGantt` alongside `<GanttChart>` and `<GanttRow>` primitives.
- Specify props and slots for start and end dates, precision, and event callbacks.
- Outline headless primitives for time-scale generation, bar management, pointer events, and keyboard interactions.
- Plan TypeScript definitions and JSDoc comments for full IDE support.

## Task
- Produce a more detailed design document using `COMPOSABLE_GANTT.md` as the primary reference, expanding on component APIs and architectural diagrams.
- [ ] API specification with props and events
- [ ] Component and slot diagrams
- [ ] Typed interface definitions
