# Implementation Step 2: Accessibility and Keyboard Support

Based on the concept and `COMPOSABLE_GANTT.md`:

- Follow the ARIA grid pattern for keyboard navigation (arrow keys, home/end, page navigation).
- Expose `aria-selected` and `data-state="selected"` attributes for styling and accessibility.
- Handle focus management and outside-click deselection using VueUse's `onClickOutside`.

## Task
- Develop a comprehensive accessibility guide referencing `COMPOSABLE_GANTT.md` and WAI-ARIA resources, covering all keyboard interactions and ARIA roles.
- [ ] ARIA role mapping table
- [ ] Keyboard interaction matrix
- [ ] Focus management examples
