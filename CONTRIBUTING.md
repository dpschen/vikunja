# Contribution Guidelines

Please check out the guidelines on https://vikunja.io/docs/development/

## Commit Messages

We recommend using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Run `npm run commitlint` after committing to verify your last commit message. This is optional and serves as a helpful warning only.
